I am a Control Systems and Robotics engineer in the process of mastering both hardware and
software skills through a long journey of building personal projects, researching, graduate
school and eventually working in the industry.
I am currently seeking full time opportunities in the field of autonomous systems, robotics or
control systems starting May 2020 and Co-op opportunities from January 2020.
I am passionate about the autonomous systems field including Robotics, Mechatronics,
Control Systems, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. I have been consistently
learning new skills and implementing algorithms for autonomous systems ranging from deep
learning through tensor flow, state estimation, sensor fusion to developing non linear
controllers for UAVs etc. Through my series of projects in robotics, I have become proficient in
understanding and implementing algorithms ranging from full stack software to complex
mathematical implementation of control systems.
The Formlabs Robotic Motion Planning and Algorithms Engineer is a perfect fit job for my
experience with implementing algorithms to robotics systems and complex control systems.
My experience with software gained through implementation in numerous projects and my
graduate level coursework in robotics make me ready for the job. As a bonus, my background
in Mechanical Engineering makes me strong in design and development of hardware, besides
being familiar with advanced dynamics and finite element analysis.
I hope to work at Formlabs soon.
